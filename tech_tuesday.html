The “series 0” models originally produced in 2015 will no longer be receiving hardware service and providers cannot order these parts to service the watches. The watches are almost 8 years old and that means Apple is planning to push them from the “vintage list” to the “obsolete list”. The “vintage list” is meant to represent the Apple products between 5 - 7 years old, these are the products soon to be “obsolete”. 

Apple seems to have the obsoleteness of its product planned out for 5 years after their release but, France has a set of laws in place that extend that to 7 years. Without the laws put in place to help consumers and that force companies like Apple to alter their plans, our device would be operable for an unexectable amount of time. New EU laws in the terms of device reparability so that Apple has to service its devices for 7 years.

Many people may think so what one edition of the watch is going obsolete but the real truth is this Edition costed $10,000 but was still always going obsolete. Such expensive product being made obsolete only à few years after their release because the company has stoped servicing te hardware. 

The series 0 watches are not the only series going obsolete, the series 2 watches are soon the be obsolete as well. The constante change and flow of new products on the market is how Apple can continue to make à profit of their technology. The after math on the changing market is the products that are get older become obsolete in the cycle of new to pld to replaced created by the company.
  
<h4>Google's AI Green Light program</h4>
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-stoplight-program-project-green-light-sustainability-traffic-110015328.html">Google's AI stoplight program is now calming traffic in a dozen cities worldwide</a><br>
It’s been two years since the debut announcement of Google's Green Light project which is projected to be a means of addressing unnecessary street pollution caused by idling at lights and stop signs. At the 2023 sustainability event this past Tuesday ( Oct 3 ) the host company Google shared some details on the early findings of the program and announced their plan for à new wave of expansions on the program's success. 

But what exactly does this program do? Green light is a program based on AI machine learning systems used to comb through past map data to calculate the projected traffic congestion. The system is used for lights and other stops to reduce idling time at these stops. The reduced idling time can reduce carbon emissions, improved traffic flow and shorten commute timings.

    Blockchain what are they? A blockchain is a database on the distribution of digital goods, much like a ledger. Blockchain is mostly used to track the exchange of cryptocurrency for maintaining a proper record of transactions, but the use of blockchain is not limited to cryptocurrency,  the purpose of blockchain is to make data immutable so that it can not be forged or falseafied. 

    Why use blockchain? Blockchain is used as a method to decentralize relivent data so that no one person or organization has control over transactions or other sensitive data. Since no one person or organization can maintain control the most common aplication of blockchain is to maintain sensitve data such as financial transactions.

    How is blockchain related to tech? Blockchain is an application of technology in our industry. As a decentralize spredsheet system for tracking records for a variety of applications most commonly financial. Blockchain is now a trusted piece of technology created for party to party transactions to facilitate trust.

    The exact definition of a blockchain is “A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network” (“What Is Blockchain and How Does It Work?”). Blockchain was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. 

    Block chains are used for a lot of things. Their main purpose is to decentralize the sharing of data when it comes to transactions between two or more parties. By decentralizing the way data is shared it can give all parties involved a sense of security and justly so. Since the data regarding transactions is decentralized no one individual or party can modify it or take control of it.  This provides security on records regarding payments data sharing stock market exchange in cryptocurrency.

    The main benefits to blockchains are the time saving, the cost saving and the tighter security due to less direct human interference. Being that blockchain is a digital ledger type system any modification can be directly traced and is recorded making tampering easily verifiable.
