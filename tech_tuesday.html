 <h4> The original Apple watch is becoming obsolete and it's Apple's fault. </h4>
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-original-apple-watch-lineup-is-officially-obsolete-083825819.html">The original Apple Watch lineup is officially obsolete</a><br>
  
The “series 0” models originally produced in 2015 will no longer be receiving hardware service and providers cannot order these parts to service the watches. The watches are almost 8 years old and that means Apple is planning to push them from the “vintage list” to the “obsolete list”. The “vintage list” is meant to represent the Apple products between 5 - 7 years old, these are the products soon to be “obsolete”. 

Apple seems to have the obsoleteness of its product planned out for 5 years after their release but, France has a set of laws in place that extend that to 7 years. Without the laws put in place to help consumers and that force companies like Apple to alter their plans, our device would be operable for an unexectable amount of time. New EU laws in the terms of device reparability so that Apple has to service its devices for 7 years.

Many people may think so what one edition of the watch is going obsolete but the real truth is this Edition costed $10,000 but was still always going obsolete. Such expensive product being made obsolete only à few years after their release because the company has stoped servicing te hardware. 

The series 0 watches are not the only series going obsolete, the series 2 watches are soon the be obsolete as well. The constante change and flow of new products on the market is how Apple can continue to make à profit of their technology. The after math on the changing market is the products that are get older become obsolete in the cycle of new to pld to replaced created by the company.
  
<h4>Google's AI Green Light program</h4>
<a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-stoplight-program-project-green-light-sustainability-traffic-110015328.html">Google's AI stoplight program is now calming traffic in a dozen cities worldwide</a><br>
It’s been two years since the debut announcement of Google's Green Light project which is projected to be a means of addressing unnecessary street pollution caused by idling at lights and stop signs. At the 2023 sustainability event this past Tuesday ( Oct 3 ) the host company Google shared some details on the early findings of the program and announced their plan for à new wave of expansions on the program's success. 

But what exactly does this program do? Green light is a program based on AI machine learning systems used to comb through past map data to calculate the projected traffic congestion. The system is used for lights and other stops to reduce idling time at these stops. The reduced idling time can reduce carbon emissions, improved traffic flow and shorten commute timings.

  <h4>what is a blockchain</h4>

    Blockchain what are they? A blockchain is a database on the distribution of digital goods, much like a ledger. Blockchain is mostly used to track the exchange of cryptocurrency for maintaining a proper record of transactions, but the use of blockchain is not limited to cryptocurrency,  the purpose of blockchain is to make data immutable so that it can not be forged or falseafied. 

    Why use blockchain? Blockchain is used as a method to decentralize relivent data so that no one person or organization has control over transactions or other sensitive data. Since no one person or organization can maintain control the most common aplication of blockchain is to maintain sensitve data such as financial transactions.

    How is blockchain related to tech? Blockchain is an application of technology in our industry. As a decentralize spredsheet system for tracking records for a variety of applications most commonly financial. Blockchain is now a trusted piece of technology created for party to party transactions to facilitate trust.

<h4>blockchain in depth</h4>

    The exact definition of a blockchain is “A blockchain is a decentralized, distributed and public digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and the consensus of the network” (“What Is Blockchain and How Does It Work?”). Blockchain was invented in 2008 by Satoshi Nakamoto. 

    Block chains are used for a lot of things. Their main purpose is to decentralize the sharing of data when it comes to transactions between two or more parties. By decentralizing the way data is shared it can give all parties involved a sense of security and justly so. Since the data regarding transactions is decentralized no one individual or party can modify it or take control of it.  This provides security on records regarding payments data sharing stock market exchange in cryptocurrency.

    The main benefits to blockchains are the time saving, the cost saving and the tighter security due to less direct human interference. Being that blockchain is a digital ledger type system any modification can be directly traced and is recorded making tampering easily verifiable.

    <h4>what is bitcion mining</h4>
    <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/09/03/climate/bitcoin-carbon-footprint-electricity.html"> bitcion</a><br>
  
    In 2009, 14 years ago you could mine bitcoin in your own home. Now you’ll need a bunch of specilized machines and software designed to mine the coin. The energy consomtion of these machines is astronomical by 2018 bitcoin was using up more energy than the nation Denmark in a year. By the year 2021 bitcoin used more energy annually than Denmark, Chile, Finland and the Netherlands. Bitcoin uses so much energy it uses close to half-a-percent of all the electricity consumed in the world, that is a lot and that is only just bitcoin imagine all the other cryptocerecy out there. 

    Within technology Energy is a very important part of how it functions. We need electricity in order to make many machines work because without it they don't have the power necessary to function.  this is clearly demonstrated with the powerful machines that are running constantly in order to mine Bitcoin. They utilize so much electricity that by 2021 Bitcoin miners used more than three times as much energy as Denmark does annually.  the reason why Bitcoin mining takes so much energy compared to how it did back in 2009 is how computers have developed the system of mining.  everything involved with Bitcoin has gotten more complex and the computers have to make guesses in an algorithm in order to mine the Bitcoin.  more guesses more chance and more chance more money so computers run more and more  effectively to keep up which causes them to take up more and more energy. 
    
    <h4>AT&T</h4>
    <a href="https://www.telecomstechnews.com/news/2023/dec/05/att-plans-most-wireless-traffic-flow-across-open-ran-by-2026/">AT&T</a><br>
    AT&T is a major competitor in the telecommunications industry. They provide a 5G network to their customers. AT&T intendens to have transitioned over 70% of it’s wireless network user traffic to it its new open-papable platform technologie by 2026. The intention with transferring to the new technology is to create flexibility and reliability within their Networks. But such a drastic change within AT&T who could tell how it's going to turn out. AT&T is not alone in developing this technology though as they are partnering with several valued suppliers such as Corning Incorporated, Dell Technologies, Ericsson, Fujitsu, and Intel.

    AT&T also intends to slingshot forward Innovations within the 5G Network and other wireless networks. One of the major concerns of AT&T with its Technologies is energy consumption not only for the environment but for the portability and sustainability of its devices. AT&T's new product will increase the competition in the US land market which is part of their plan to simulate Innovation and efficiencies Within the technology.
