      <td>This week I have my first introduction to coding through replett in the language HTML.  my computer science class is interesting with interesting people I can get along with.</td>
      <td>We just had our test on binary. I think I did pretty well, all things considered logic gates are very interesting and fun to mess around with but they can also be really annoying.  I always seem to think the solution to a problem with logic gates is a lot more complicated than it really needs to be and when I dumb it down it works. So far this computer science class has the most interesting content this semester.  I'm anxious to be able to code without needing to look at a guide every 2 seconds and a website is a very simple but interesting place to start.</td>

      <td>this past week in computer science i had five small tasks to complete in the hapara workspace. though the five small tasks wre overshadowed by a poster creating project on storage. i worked on the project with Ben a classmate of mine for first period ICB2O</td>
      <td>Week #4 was filled with typing club, lerning CMU, dismantiling computers and on friday we had watched a few videos on indiginous culture including, one on a man who made lacrose sticks. we also had a group project to draw using code that i completed with Isabel and Ben.</td>

        <td>This week was the first week we did a tech Tuesday. There were a variety of topics and articles that came out only that same day. It's interesting how fast news can travel and is forgotten. On top of our first tech Tuesday we also got a visit from some Representatives at Nokia.  I didn't know that Nokia did more than just those old phones and that there are real tech company striving for innovation. Nokia seems like a very interesting company I'll keep in mind for the future and I was very happy to learn about the company.</td>
        <td>This week was shorter than most just like last week cuz of the 4-day weekend provided by Thanksgiving. This week we had CMU leading up to a CMU quiz which was the most eventful part of the week.</td>

        <td>Starting our second unit in CMU was interesting. We learned about most events and now instead of a solid picture we can code moving things. It's exciting to be able to explore a new Avenue with more code available and more opportunities. </td>
        <td>The week is starting to get split up with CMU on Mondays and other things on different days of the week. I can mostly tell what's going to happen.  because of the more structured schedule of the week I can plan ahead better which I appreciate.  Learning about AI has been interesting. Machine learning models are unique compared to other areas of tech I have experienced and I'm excited to know more.</td>

        <td>A pretty normal week we had a Pity day on Friday though so it was shorter and with Remembrance Day we didn't get a whole lot of time in computer science, only really three classes this week so it was short. And a final lesson in AI top off that we were supposed to have a quiz in CMU apparently but remembrance day pushed that.</td>
